# GroceryManager

## App Description

Grocery Manager project for my css 142 class at UWB. This project reads from a text file to find out how much of each item is received in a shipment before reading over customer oreders.
While reading over customer orders, the program checks to see if we run out of any items and adds the item to the restock list. At the end of the day the restock list is read over.

## Motivation Behind the project/why I built it

I created this project to learn about mapping in java, as well as to gain experience with larger projects that deal with many elements

## What I learned from this project

I expanded my knowledge of java, HashSets, fileIO, multiple classes, and OOP

## App usage (installation on your local machine)

To use this app on your local machine simply download this git repo and run the GroceryManager.java file
